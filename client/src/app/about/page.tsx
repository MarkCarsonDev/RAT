          From submitting applications to waiting for interviews, the journey
          often feels like navigating a black box. As a couple of college
          students, we knew it all too well.

        <Typography className="bottom-pad" variant="h5">
          Thatâ€™s why, in 2024, we began SqueakPeek to allow you to connect with
          other job applicants, share experiences, and track your progress every
          step of the way. Through message threads, you can communicate about
          opportunities, discuss interview insights, and feel more informed as
          you move forward in your career.
