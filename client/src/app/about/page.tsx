        From submitting applications to waiting for interviews, the journey
        often feels like navigating a black box. As a couple of college

        Thatâ€™s why, in 2024, we began SqueakPeek to allow you to connect with
        other job applicants, share experiences, and track your progress every
        step of the way. Through message threads, you can communicate about
        opportunities, discuss interview insights, and feel more informed as you
        move forward in your career.
